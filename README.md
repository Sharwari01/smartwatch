# Daily Activity Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`, along with basic machine learning techniques using `sklearn`. The dataset `dailyActivity_merged.csv` is analyzed to gain insights into physical activity, calorie burn, and various activity levels (e.g., very active, lightly active) from users' daily records.

### Key Objectives
1. Load, clean, and process the dataset for analysis.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations to understand patterns in daily activity, calories, and steps.
3. Use machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest Classifier, Linear Regression) to predict activity levels and calorie burn based on daily steps.

### Dataset
- **File**: `dailyActivity_merged.csv`
- **Contents**: The dataset contains daily activity data including steps, minutes of various activity levels, calories burned, and distances.

## Installation and Requirements
To run this project, the following libraries are required:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
